1. In the notes of Week 1, we compared & contrasted MLOps with DevOps. In this question, you need to understand what is meant by the term ***AIOps***, & then contrast it with MLOps.</br></br>
***Soln :*** AIOps is all about supporting and reacting to its issues in real-time and providing analytics to your operations teams. These functions include performance monitoring, event analysis, correlation, and IT automation. According to Gartner, AIOps combines big data and machine learning to automate IT operations processes. Therefore, the end goal of AIOps is to automatically spot issues in day-to-day IT operations and proactively react to them using Artificial Intelligence.
            </br></br>MLOps, on the other hand, focuses on managing training and testing data that is needed to create machine learning models effectively. It is all about monitoring and management of ML models. It focuses on the Machine Learning operationalization pipeline. AIOps is all about applying cognitive computing techniques to improve IT operations, but it is not to be confused with MLOps.
            </br></br>MLOps or AIOps both aim to serve the same end goal; i.e. business automation. While MLOps bridges the gap between model building and deployment, AIOps focuses on determining and reacting to issues in IT operations in real-time so as to manage risks independently.</br></br>

2. ***Interpretable Machine Learning*** is another concept that has attracted lot of attention recently & is promoted by most of the MLOps frameworks. Explain what it means for a linear regression model to be interpretable. You may find [this resource](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) useful.</br></br>
***Soln :*** The goal of science is to gain knowledge, but many problems are solved with big datasets and black box machine learning models. The model itself becomes the source of knowledge instead of the data. Interpretability makes it possible to extract this additional knowledge captured by the model. 
              </br></br>Linear regression model is one where data set points are represented in n-dimensional space depending on number of parameters (n). These points in space are classified into multiple groups using a divider which is defined using linear combination of n variables. 
              </br></br>For example, If you have 2 parameters (n=2), then we can plot these points in 2-D plane and divide these points using a straight line with 2 variables (x & y). 
               </br></br>So we can interpret this logic by simply understanding that related points lie together in one cluster and hence different clusters can be divided using this line which can approximately classify the data set in various categories. Hence a linear regression model turns out to be interpretable.</br></br>
