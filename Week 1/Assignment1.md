1. In the notes of Week 1, we compared & contrasted MLOps with DevOps. In this question, you need to understand what is meant by the term ***AIOps***, & then contrast it with MLOps.

2. ***Interpretable Machine Learning*** is another concept that has attracted lot of attention recently & is promoted by most of the MLOps frameworks. Explain what it means for a linear regression model to be interpretable. You may find [this resource](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/) useful.
